Emotion detection

# Abstraction:
    In this work ,user’s emotion using its facial expressions will be detected. These expressions can be derived from the live feed via system’s camera or any pre-existing image available in the memory . Emotions possessed by humans can be recognized and has a vast scope of study in the computer vision industry upon which several researches have already been done. The work has been implemented using Python (3.8), Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and NumPy. The scanned image (testing dataset) is being compared to training dataset and thusemotion is predicted. The objective of this paper is to develop a system which can analyze the image and predict the expression of the person. The study proves that this procedure is workable

 * Applications:
    * Some common and widely used applications of emotion detection are:
        * app and product development
        * Immersive gaming
        * Improved learning practices 
        * Improvised wed development

* This project is submitted for the hacknagpur hackathon happening between 26th-30th December 2020, and this was submitted by the team "Binary Tree Nodes".
